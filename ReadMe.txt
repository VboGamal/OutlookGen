This is an automated Python script utilizing the Selenium WebDriver. I developed this script to address the need for multiple Outlook accounts required for my job.
I decided to create and share this Python script to streamline the process.

-- System Requirements:
    Google Chrome version 126.0.6478.127
    Google Chrome must be installed on your system.

-- Script Features:
  The script is configured to wait for the user to manually bypass CAPTCHA, ensuring smooth execution without interruptions.
  Account details are saved in a file named saved_mails.txt.
  A common password used for the accounts is "RandPass13$".

-- Installation Instructions:
  Install the Selenium WebDriver library by running:
  "pip install selenium"

I hope you find this script useful.
